# Wren API Tutorial (Web)

This repo demonstrates how you might use Wren's API to build a web app. This uses vanilla JS, no frameworks, so that you can see how things work without them.

## Getting started

- Open index.html in your browser.
- Enter your Wren API token on the page.
- Use the offset tool!
